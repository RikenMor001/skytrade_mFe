# Getting started
Run npm install and npm webpack on both the apps individually and you'll be good to go.
# Where will be these apps hosted?
App 1 will be hosted on localhost:3000 and app 2 on localhost:3001. 
# Advantages of using module federation
Making multiple different applications yet managed via a single repo and independent of each other, shares components dynamically among each other.
# Disadvantages of using module federation
Takes away the advantage of server side rendering (SSR), which is the actual reason why nextjs is so popular nowadays.
